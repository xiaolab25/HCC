![Workflow diagram](1.png)

## Overview
This repository accompanies our SCI manuscript on the spatial fibroinflammatory architecture of solid tumors.
It shares the analysis code, figure-generation workflow, and supplementary materials used in the study.

## Highlights
- **Spatial architecture**: Captures the organization of immune and stromal components in the tumor microenvironment.
- **Therapeutic efficacy**: Links fibroinflammatory patterns to treatment response.
- **Reproducibility**: Designed for transparency and reuse in related studies.

## Repository contents
